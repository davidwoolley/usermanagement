# Datatrain User Management Package

In many ways this package is an exercise in building a 'composer' compliant package. The goal is to provide a working implementation of Sentry 2 using 'read to go' controllers, views and email templates.

### Features

### Installation
Add `datatrain\user` as a requirement to composer.json:

```javascript
{
    "require": {
        "datatrain/user": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Update your packages with `composer update` or install with `composer install`.

Once Composer has installed or updated your packages you need to register User with Laravel itself. Open up app/config/app.php and find the providers key towards the bottom and add:

```php
'Datatrain\User\UserServiceProvider'
```
### Configuration
Whilst this package comes 'pre-configured', most users will want to substitute their own layout, views and templates. This is achieved in Laravel using the artisan config:publish command

```
$ php artisan config:publish datatrain/user
```

This will publish `config.php` in the `app/config/packages/datatrain/user` directory. You may also specify an environment specific directory if desired.

This project is no longer maintained. If you are interested in taking ownership please let me know.
